## ✨ What is EduBetter?

EduBetter addresses one of the biggest challenges faced by students from underserved communities:  
- Lack of awareness about **available scholarships**  
- Difficulty in accessing **free study materials**  
- Interfaces that are **not beginner-friendly** or **not available in local languages**  

EduBetter solves these problems by providing:  
- 🎓 A **Scholarship Matcher** that shows only the scholarships a student is eligible for (based on class, board, state, caste/category, income, disability, minority status, etc.)  
- 📚 A **Resource Hub** where students can access textbooks for **all boards in India** — CBSE, ICSE, and every State Board — for Classes 1 to 12, in **English, Hindi, and other regional languages**  
- 🌐 A **multilingual UI**, designed to be translated into **almost all regional languages of India** (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Odia, Assamese, Urdu, etc.)  
- 🎨 A **user-friendly interface** built for students and parents who may be using digital tools for the first time — clean design, large buttons, easy navigation
